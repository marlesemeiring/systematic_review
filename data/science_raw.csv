This study was conducted to evaluate the inhibitory effect of sirolimus, a natural macrolide compound, against white rot of mustard tuber caused by S. sclerotiorum in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that sirolimus was able to reduce the mycelial growth, sclerogenesis as well as myceliogenic and carpogenic germinations of three isolates of the pathogen. Application of sirolimus markedly increased activity of Î²-N-acetyl hexosaminidase, endochitinase and Î² -1,3-glucanase in plant leaves. Moreover, a significant increase was observed in the level of polyphenoloxidase and peroxidase in plant leaves two and four days after application of sirolimus. The results of in vitro tests showed that sirolimus at the concentration of 100â€¯nM completely inhibited disease severity. The treatment with sirolimus enhanced relative conductivity of S. sclerotiorum mycelia over time compared with control. An increase of carbohydrate leakage was observed in the pathogen mycelia incubated with sirolimus. The content of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) markedly increased at 5â€¯h and the highest MDA content was observed after 20â€¯h. Due to exposure to sirolimus, a decrease percentage of catalase activity was observed in pathogen mycelia. In conclusion, this study showed that sirolimus can be considered as an effective substance against white rot of tuber mustard caused by S. sclerotiorum.","2020-09-20","2021-01-12 07:35:17","2021-01-12 07:35:17",NA,"109484",NA,NA,271,NA,"Scientia Horticulturae",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Carpogenic; Endochitinase; MDA; Peroxidase; Sirolimus",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The mite Acarus siro L. and the collembolan Folsomia candida Willem are known to be able to transmit the mycoparasite to uninfected sclerotia of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary in soil, and consequently the mechanisms of transmission of the mycoparasite by these animals have been investigated in detail. To facilitate this work, a novel method for surface sterilising mites was developed. In an initial investigation, A. siro was found to carry inoculum externally and in the gut. Indeed, almost all faecal pellets collected from either A. siro or F. candida, following feeding on C. minitans, contained germinable inoculum of the mycoparasite. Microscopic examination showed that faeces from these animals consisted mainly of conidia or fragments of conidium, but that only intact conidia gave rise to growth of C. minitans. Passage through the gut of either animal reduced percentage germination of conidia to 11 and 60% in mite and collembolan faeces, respectively, compared to 99% in controls not subjected to gut passage. In addition, germination in mite faeces was delayed by approximately 12h compared to controls. However, subsequent germ tube extension from surviving conidia appeared unaffected by gut passage. Individual faecal pellets of A. siro were found to contain sufficient inoculum of the mycoparasite to initiate infection of sclerotia in moist sterile sand and non-sterile soil. The relevance of these results to the glasshouse and field situation is discussed.","1998-12-01","2021-01-12 07:35:18","2021-01-12 07:35:18",NA,"1937-1945",NA,14,30,NA,"Soil Biology and Biochemistry",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The objective behind this study was to develop and evaluate a field-based non-injury method of inoculation technique for Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) in oilseed Brassica, caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary. The non-injury method of screening technique involves stem inoculation using a five days old mycelial mat on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plug placed on the top of sterile water-soaked cotton pad firmly wrapped over the internodal region with parafilm at the basal portion of the stem (15â€“20Â cm above the ground) in the field. Inoculation without injury substantiates the natural means of infection in the field and the use of moist cotton pad keeps humidity for longer to initiate infection even in case of adverse climatic conditions. Disease development on the inoculated stem was measured by the length and width of the lesion. The symptom appears with water-soaked lesion formation and spreading deeper and wider on the stem in >90% of inoculated plants. During the experiment, about 800 Brassica germplasms including their wild relatives were screened and evaluated for three consecutive years using near-natural (non-injury) method of disease inoculation in the field. The Inoculation severity index (ISI) obtained during these years at Pusa, New Delhi were significantly similar and correlated with the natural infection measured in terms of disease severity index (DSI) on selected germplasm in the sick plot at ICAR-DRMR, Bharatpur. The significant correlations obtained among the used Brassica lines that were earlier not subjected for natural screening suggest the potential of this technique in evaluating the breeding material for SSR before confirmation with natural infection in the field.","2020-08-01","2021-01-12 07:35:20","2021-01-12 07:35:20",NA,"105983",NA,NA,175,NA,"Journal of Microbiological Methods",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Resistance; Inoculation; Lesion; Oilseed Brassica; Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It can infect a wide variety of plants, causing serious disease in many types of crops, such as rapeseed, sunflower and soybean. Sclerotinia stem rot caused by this fungus affects main crops and has led to great economic loss. Elicitors are a group of compounds that inspire the host plant to produce an immune response against invading pathogens. This study describes a protein that has high homology with the Trichoderma elicitor Sm1 and was found in the genome of S. sclerotiorum. We named this protein SsSm1. To determine whether this protein has an elicitor function like its homology protein, we constructed a heterologous expression vector for SsSm1 and expressed it in Escherichia coli. The protein of heterologous expression led to the formation of lesions in tobacco that closely resemble hypersensitive response lesions. Transient expression of the encoding gene of SsSm1 in tobacco leaves also caused hypersensitive response. Then, RNA silencing was used to identify the function of SsSm1. The hyphal growth and pathogenicity of silenced transformants were shown to be obviously lagging and branched abnormally. Transformants produced less infection cushions and deformed sclerotiorum. In addition, SsSm1 silencing caused weak tolerance to NaCl, sorbitol and SDS, and the sensitivity of mutants to carbendazim was also significantly decreased. Based on the above results, we speculate that this protein may be related to the development of hyphae, infection cushions and sclerotiorum, but the specific molecular mechanism needs to be studied further.","2018-05-01","2021-01-12 07:35:20","2021-01-12 07:35:20",NA,"37-46",NA,NA,270,NA,"Plant Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"(Lib.) de Bary; Cerato-platanin; Elicitor; HR; RNAi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These genes are hypothesized to encode master regulatory proteins required for aspects of sexual development ranging from fertilization through fertile fruiting body development. Experimentally, loss-of-function mutants were created for the conserved core mating-type genes (MAT1-1-1, and MAT1-2-1), and the lineage-specific genes found only in S. sclerotiorum and closely related fungi (MAT1-1-5, and MAT1-2-4). The MAT1-1-1, MAT1-1-5, and MAT1-2-1 mutants are able to form ascogonia but are blocked in all aspects of apothecium development. These mutants also exhibit defects in secondary sexual characters including lower numbers of spermatia. The MAT1-2-4 mutants are delayed in carpogenic germination accompanied with altered disc morphogenesis and ascospore production. They too produce lower numbers of spermatia. All four MAT gene mutants showed alterations in the expression of putative pheromone precursor (Ppg-1) and pheromone receptor (PreA, PreB) genes.

The aim of our research was to use a spring oilseed rape variety sown in autumn or an early-flowering variety of winter oilseed rape to predict the infection pressure of S.Â sclerotiorum in a given year. Field experiments were conducted in 2008â€“2012 at the experimental station of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague at ÄŒervenÃ½ Ãšjezd, 20Â km west of Prague. In the experiment, we used one variety of spring oilseed rape (LuÅ¾nice, LU) and one early-flowering variety of winter oilseed rape (Californium, CA). The methodology of the petal test involved isolating pathogenic fungi from fallen petals on a nutrient medium (potato dextrose agar) in Petri dishes. The first term of collection was the beginning of petal fall (BBCH 61) and the last term was the end of flowering (BBCH 69). The dishes with petals were visually analysed after 1 week. The results were compared with the actual occurrence of white mould of rape in the stand. The occurrence of white mould of rape was strongly influenced by the progress of weather conditions over the given year. Infected petals and stems with symptoms of white mould of rape were found to be moderately correlated (rÂ =Â 0.80). Spread of white mould spores was mostly observed in two terms (BBCH 62 and BBCH 65). Statistically significant differences were not observed in the infection of petals of spring (LU) and winter (CA) oilseed rape. Spring oilseed rape (LU) and early-flowering varieties of winter oilseed rape (CA) can be used to determine the strength of infection pressure of S.Â sclerotiorum in the stand in a given year, thereby improving protection against white mould of rape.","2016-02-01","2021-01-12 07:36:05","2021-01-12 07:36:05",NA,"127-131",NA,NA,80,NA,"Crop Protection",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Diagnostics; Petal test; Spring rapeseed; White mould of rape; Winter rapeseed",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Cabbage sub-plots were established on larger whole-plots which had been under rotations of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), clover (Trifolium pratense L.), rye (Secale cereale L.) or sweet corn (Zea mays L. var. rugosa Bonaf.) for the two previous years. Weed densities were measured 21d after cabbage transplanting. Weed community response to the rotational crops varied by location. In general, herbicides provided the best weed control in cabbage, but non-chemical practices (mulching, cultivation) were as effective as herbicides in controlling A. artemisiifolia. This weed was associated with reductions in cabbage size at all three sites. The results demonstrate that rotational crop schemes in conjunction with non-chemical management strategies can be effective in controlling weed infestations. Dry weather during the growing season prevented the development of white mold. However, cabbage quality was reduced by a rot caused by a species of Fusarium.

It was determined that B19 and P12 increased crop germination potential (GP) from the common bean by 14.5% compared to control seeds; these strains also increased root length (10.4 and 15%, respectively) and stem length (20.2 and 30%, respectively) compared to the control; however, as for the B14 strain, no increases in growth parameters were detected. In addition, all the treatments that combined two bacilli: B14â€¯+â€¯B19, B14â€¯+â€¯P12 and B19â€¯+â€¯P12, generated beneficial effects on GP and seedling growth compared to control seeds, but not compared to a single inoculant. B19 and P12 strains synthesized auxins at concentrations of 5.71 and 4.90â€¯mg/mL, respectively, and it was qualitatively determined that they synthesize siderophores. In addition, previous studies have determined that B14 produces auxins in a concentration of 10.10â€¯mg/mL, and qualitatively synthesizes siderophores. The phytosanitary state of the white bean cv. Alubia control seeds revealed bacterial contamination in 87% of all the evaluated seeds and different fungi such as Cladosporium sp., Fusarium sp., and Rhizopus sp. Bean seeds treated with B14, B19 or P12 showed no growth of contaminating bacteria or of pathogenic fungi; in fact, bacilli inoculum development was observed in all seeds. Additionally, B19, P12 and B14 strains inhibited in vitro the development of 9 native S. sclerotiorum strains isolated from the Salta region, with FI ranging between 60 and 100%.

It can infect a wide variety of plants, causing serious disease in many types of crops, such as rapeseed, sunflower and soybean. Sclerotinia stem rot caused by this fungus affects main crops and has led to great economic loss. Elicitors are a group of compounds that inspire the host plant to produce an immune response against invading pathogens. This study describes a protein that has high homology with the Trichoderma elicitor Sm1 and was found in the genome of S. sclerotiorum. We named this protein SsSm1. To determine whether this protein has an elicitor function like its homology protein, we constructed a heterologous expression vector for SsSm1 and expressed it in Escherichia coli. The protein of heterologous expression led to the formation of lesions in tobacco that closely resemble hypersensitive response lesions. Transient expression of the encoding gene of SsSm1 in tobacco leaves also caused hypersensitive response. Then, RNA silencing was used to identify the function of SsSm1. The hyphal growth and pathogenicity of silenced transformants were shown to be obviously lagging and branched abnormally. Transformants produced less infection cushions and deformed sclerotiorum. In addition, SsSm1 silencing caused weak tolerance to NaCl, sorbitol and SDS, and the sensitivity of mutants to carbendazim was also significantly decreased. Based on the above results, we speculate that this protein may be related to the development of hyphae, infection cushions and sclerotiorum, but the specific molecular mechanism needs to be studied further.","2018-05-01","2021-01-12 07:36:07","2021-01-12 07:36:07",NA,"37-46",NA,NA,270,NA,"Plant Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"(Lib.) de Bary; Cerato-platanin; Elicitor; HR; RNAi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Replacement of the fungicide with high-temperature surface heat treatment poses a dilemma: excessive heating will cause damage whereas insufficient heating will result in incomplete disinfection. This problem is further compounded by the difficulty in providing uniform surface heating. To alleviate this problem, a system for the uniform application of high-temperature short-duration steam disinfection was developed using accurate real-time temperature monitoring of individual produce segments by thermal imaging. Uniform short-duration high-temperature heat was delivered from above by steam jets combined with electric steam-drying elements and reflectors. Produce was subjected to rotational and linear motions to expose each surface segment to the same amount of heat. The novel use of thermal imaging to monitor surface temperature in steam systems was essential for determining transferred heat and heating uniformity in a treated object. The resultant, uniform application of short-duration high-temperature steam provided surface heat-disinfection with minimal internal heating and damage. Application of the steam treatment immediately after carrot hydro-cooling reduced post-storage phytotoxic color change by 60â€“80% and resulted in significantly reduced sensitivity to post-storage soft rots caused by S. sclerotiorum. Carrot sprouting was not increased by the steam treatment, suggesting retention of the hydro-cooling's physiological effect. These results suggest that precise heat treatment can be optimally applied after hydro-cooling to improve postharvest quality of carrots in a procedure that is harmless to man and the environment.","2011-03-01","2021-01-12 07:36:08","2021-01-12 07:36:08",NA,"265-271",NA,3,59,NA,"Postharvest Biology and Technology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Carrot; Hydro-cooling; Postharvest disease; Steam; Thermal imaging",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Carrots were stored in five different atmospheres: high relative humidity (HRA), unadjusted cold room atmosphere (RA), and three atmospheres with modified CO2 and O2 concentrations (referred to as A, B and C). Containers fitted with silicone membranes of varying surface areas were used to maintain these atmospheres. Carrots in one-half of the containers were inoculated with S. sclerotiorum. The experiment was carried out in a cold room maintained at 1Â°C and was terminated after 6 months. The mean CO2/O2 percentages for modified atmospheres were 1.17/14.19, 1.52/12.11, 3.03/4.57, 3.81/3.73, 4.26/4.47 and 6.09/3.03% for treatments A1, B1, C1 (carrots without inoculum), A2, B2 and C2 (carrots with inoculum), respectively. All modified CO2 and O2 treatments provided better control of Sclerotina rot than did HRA and RA. Carrots of treatments HRA1, A1, B1 and C1 (carrots without inoculum) were kept for evaluation by a taste panel and quality assessment. Taste panel evaluation indicated that carrots from treatment C1 were superior to store-bought carrots and carrots from other treatments. Quality assessment indicated that work (defined as load versus blade displacement when carrots were cut with an Instron apparatus) was significantly greater for HRA1 as compared to the other treatments and that modulus (defined as the slope of the curve of force versus the distance travelled during the cut) was significantly higher for C1 than HRA1 and RA1.

The results showed that sirolimus was able to reduce the mycelial growth, sclerogenesis as well as myceliogenic and carpogenic germinations of three isolates of the pathogen. Application of sirolimus markedly increased activity of Î²-N-acetyl hexosaminidase, endochitinase and Î² -1,3-glucanase in plant leaves. Moreover, a significant increase was observed in the level of polyphenoloxidase and peroxidase in plant leaves two and four days after application of sirolimus. The results of in vitro tests showed that sirolimus at the concentration of 100â€¯nM completely inhibited disease severity. The treatment with sirolimus enhanced relative conductivity of S. sclerotiorum mycelia over time compared with control. An increase of carbohydrate leakage was observed in the pathogen mycelia incubated with sirolimus. The content of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) markedly increased at 5â€¯h and the highest MDA content was observed after 20â€¯h.

In contrast to the conventional application technique, dropleg nozzles are kept below the flowering canopy to restrict the exposure of pollinators to active ingredients of insecticides. The Julius KÃ¼hn-Institut (JKI) tested the efficacy of different insecticides using the dropleg technique compared to the conventional technique, on insect pests in field trials conducted from 2015 to 2017 in the area of Braunschweig. The crop was treated at full flowering (BBCH 65) for three consecutive years. The tested insecticides were Biscaya (72â€¯g a. i. haâˆ’1 thiacloprid), Mavrik (48â€¯g a. i. haâˆ’1 tau-fluvalinate), and Mospilan SG (40â€¯g a. i. haâˆ’1 acetamiprid).

The emergence of new generation beetles (Brassicogethes aeneus (Fabricius), C. obstrictus) was recorded from BBCH 78 onwards, using photoeclectors. At least twice during each season, oilseed rape plants were assessed for D. brassicae injury. The new dropleg application technique showed similar efficacy on pest insects compared to the conventional spraying technique. Nevertheless, the abundance of pests was not always sufficient to get clear results. Results especially on D. brassicae indicate that the dropleg technique had a comparable efficacy under moderate pest pressure conditions observed in our study. Further research under conditions with a higher abundance of C. obstrictus, as well as research on the effects of dropleg technique on parasitoids of oilseed rape pests, is needed.

The superoxide ion is an important intermediate in the generation of ROS having a key regulatory function during plantâ€“microbe interactions and is an important component in fungal development. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) family contributes to frontline defense via detoxification of reactive superoxide radical anions. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen with a broad host range. S.Â sclerotiorum produces the non-specific phytotoxin and key pathogenicity factor, oxalic acid (OA). We have identified an S.Â sclerotiorum SOD (Sssod1) with high similarity to CuZnSODs. Sssod1 contains an open reading frame of 908Â bp in length and is predicted to encode a protein of 155 amino acids that harbors the entire hallmark motifs associated with SOD function. Treatment with the CuZnSOD inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC) resulted in delayed hyphal growth and sclerotial development in a dose-dependent manner. Mutants generated carrying an Sssod1 deletion (Î”Sssod1) exhibited morphological defects similar to those observed with the inhibitor treatment. Moreover, Î”Sssod1 was more sensitive than wild-type to menadione, a redox cycling agent. Expression of Sssod1 was induced following treatment with oxidizing agents and during interaction with plant host tissue the Î”Sssod1 mutant was significantly reduced in virulence on both tomato and tobacco plants compared to wild-type. Interestingly, pathogenicity of the superoxide dismutase mutant was mostly restored following supplementation with oxalate. We also observed that Î”Sssod1 was reduced in oxalate production by half. In accordance with reduced virulence, Î”Sssod1 induced a host oxidative burst in adjacent uninfected cells, a phenotype indicative of active pathogen recognition by the host. Intriguingly, during wild-type infection, host ROS production was significantly reduced. These results suggest that wild-type Sclerotinia suppresses host defense responses during infection.","2012-04-01","2021-01-12 07:36:14","2021-01-12 07:36:14",NA,"14-23",NA,NA,78,NA,"Physiological and Molecular Plant Pathology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reactive oxygen species; Oxalate; Oxidative stress tolerance; Superoxide dismutase",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The objective behind this study was to develop and evaluate a field-based non-injury method of inoculation technique for Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) in oilseed Brassica, caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary. The non-injury method of screening technique involves stem inoculation using a five days old mycelial mat on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plug placed on the top of sterile water-soaked cotton pad firmly wrapped over the internodal region with parafilm at the basal portion of the stem (15â€“20Â cm above the ground) in the field. Inoculation without injury substantiates the natural means of infection in the field and the use of moist cotton pad keeps humidity for longer to initiate infection even in case of adverse climatic conditions. Disease development on the inoculated stem was measured by the length and width of the lesion. The symptom appears with water-soaked lesion formation and spreading deeper and wider on the stem in >90% of inoculated plants. During the experiment, about 800 Brassica germplasms including their wild relatives were screened and evaluated for three consecutive years using near-natural (non-injury) method of disease inoculation in the field. The Inoculation severity index (ISI) obtained during these years at Pusa, New Delhi were significantly similar and correlated with the natural infection measured in terms of disease severity index (DSI) on selected germplasm in the sick plot at ICAR-DRMR, Bharatpur. The significant correlations obtained among the used Brassica lines that were earlier not subjected for natural screening suggest the potential of this technique in evaluating the breeding material for SSR before confirmation with natural infection in the field.","2020-08-01","2021-01-12 07:36:17","2021-01-12 07:36:17",NA,"105983",NA,NA,175,NA,"Journal of Microbiological Methods",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Resistance; Inoculation; Lesion; Oilseed Brassica; Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Considering the diversity of biologically active substances, including those growth-promoting and stabilizing various pathogens contained in extracts, composts have a large potential to successfully replace the massively used pesticides. The effect of various concentrations of water compost extracts with the addition of polymers obtained from thermoplastic corn starch and polyethylene on the linear growth, biomass, and sporulation of the following polyphagous fungi was assessed under in situ and in vitro conditions: Fusarium culmorum (W.G. Smith), Fusarium graminearum Schwabe, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary, Rhizoctonia solani KÃ¼hn, Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissler. The studies revealed that the fungistatic activity was determined by the kind and concentration of compost extract added to the medium, as well as by the fungus kind. The analyzed compost extracts blocked the linear growth of the tested fungi on average by 22%, biomass increment by 51%, and sporulation by 57%. F. culmorum and S. sclerotiorum proved to be the most sensitive to the tested compost extracts. It was found that the extract from compost with the addition of polymer with the highest share of polyethylene blocked the sporulation of F. culmorum by 87% and F. graminearum by 92%. In turn, composts with the addition of polymers with the highest share of a biocomponent weakened the fungistatic activity of composts. The authors demonstrated that the addition of microbiological inoculum to one of the composts enhanced the fungistatic activity with respect to S. sclerotiorum, F. graminearum, and F. culmorum. The obtained results can be used to better understand the growth-promoting and suppression effects of compost extracts with polymer addition, help to enhance crop production, and constitute a paradigm shift towards the development of the next generation of compost with applications in a range of new fields.","2018-09-01","2021-01-12 07:36:18","2021-01-12 07:36:18",NA,"1063-1075",NA,NA,635,NA,"Science of The Total Environment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Phytopathogenic fungi; Compost extracts; Linear growth; Polymer materials; Sporulation; Trace elements",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The enzyme had a high affinity for spermidine and spermine (Kmâˆ¼5.5 and 1.2Î¼M, respectively), and also oxidized norspermidine (Kmâˆ¼64.0Î¼M). Natural and synthetic diamines, cyclohexylamine, the putrescine analogue 1-aminooxy-3-aminopropane, and several polyamine analogues had inhibitory effects on polyamine oxidase activity and none were substrates. No inhibitory effect was observed on spermidine oxidation when the reaction product 1,3-diaminopropane was added. By contrast, 1-aminooxy-3-aminopropane showed mixed inhibition kinetics and a Ki value of 0.113mM. In addition, in vitro enzymatic activity assays showed that the oligoamine [3,8,13,18,23,28,33,38,43,48-deca-aza-(trans-25)-pentacontene], the tetramine 1,14-bis-[ethylamino]-5,10-diazatetradecane, and the pentamine 1,19-bis-[ethylamino]-5,10,15-triazanonadecane, displayed potent competitive inhibitory activities against polyamine oxidase with Ki values of 5.8, 110.0 and 7.6nM, respectively, where cyclohexylamine was a weak competitive inhibitor with a Ki value of 0.5mM. These analogues did not inhibit mycelial growth of the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) De Bary and the bacterium Pseudomonas viridiflava (Burkholder) Dowson in vitro. On the contrary, with concentrations similar to those used for polyamine analogues, guazatine (a well-known fungicide and at the same time, a polyamine oxidase inhibitor) inhibited (âˆ¼85%) S. sclerotiorum mycelial growth on Czapek-Dox medium. Finally, the analogue 1,19-bis-ethylamino-5,10,15-triazanonadecane inhibited polyamine oxidase activity observed in segments of maize leaves in vivo. The results obtained provide insights into research on the influence of polyamine oxidase activity on plant biotic and abiotic stresses.","2008-10-01","2021-01-12 07:36:20","2021-01-12 07:36:20",NA,"2552-2558",NA,14,69,NA,"Phytochemistry",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1-Aminooxy-3-aminopropane; Gramineae; Maize; Oat; Oxidation; Polyamine analogues; Polyamine oxidase inhibition",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, baseline sensitivity of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary to cyprodinil was determined using 100 strains collected from the fields in Jiangsu Province of China. The EC50 (50% effective concentration) values ranged from 0.0636â€“0.8163â€¯Î¼g/ml with a mean value of 0.1869 (Â±0.1118)â€¯ug/ml for mycelial growth. Nine cyprodinil-resistant mutants (Range of resistance factor: 20.22â€“271.59) were obtained from sensitive strains exposed on PDA medium amended with cyprodinil and the resistance was stable after their ten transfers on PDA without the fungicide or stored at 4â€¯Â°C for two months. There was positive cross-resistance between cyprodinil and pyrimethanil but not to fludioxonil, dimetachlone, procymidone, carbendazim and boscalid in S. sclerotiorum. Compared with the parental strains, all of the nine cyprodinil-resistant mutants decreased in sclerotial production. The dry weight of mycelia, pathogenicity and cell membrane permeability of most resistant mutants decreased. The mycelial growth, oxalic acid content, and the response to various stress for resistant mutants were almost the same as the sensitive parental strains. Sequencing alignment results showed that there was no alteration of amino acid in cystathionine Î³-synthase (MetB) and cystathionine Î²-lyase (MetC) between cyprodinil-resistant mutants and their sensitive parental strains, which indicated that MetB or MetC was not the molecular target of cyprodinil in S. sclerotiorum. The addition of amino acids L-methionine, L-cystine or L-cysteine decreased the inhibition of cyprodinil against mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum, which indicated that cyprodinil could not only inhibited methionine biosynthesis but also suppressed cystine and cysteine biosynthesis. These results will contribute to evaluating the resistance risk of cyprodinil for management of the plant diseases of Sclerotinia stem rot caused by S. sclerotiorum and further increase our understanding about the mode of action of cyprodinil.","2018-04-01","2021-01-12 07:36:20","2021-01-12 07:36:20",NA,"80-89",NA,NA,146,NA,"Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cyprodinil; Mode of action; Resistance risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Double application of PA-23 on canola plants challenged with the ascospores of S. sclerotiorum triggered increased levels of hydrolytic enzymes including chitinase and Î²-1,3-glucanase in canola plants. In addition, it also triggered the expression of the pathogenesis-related protein PR3.

The laboratory fludioxonil mutants were less fitter than their parental isolates in terms of mycelial radial growth, pathogenicity and sclerotial production. Moreover, on PDA amended with NaCl, the laboratory fludioxonil mutants grew more slowly than their fludioxonil-sensitive parents, especially at lower concentrations of NaCl.

Cabbage sub-plots were established on larger whole-plots which had been under rotations of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), clover (Trifolium pratense L.), rye (Secale cereale L.) or sweet corn (Zea mays L. var. rugosa Bonaf.) for the two previous years. Weed densities were measured 21d after cabbage transplanting. Weed community response to the rotational crops varied by location. In general, herbicides provided the best weed control in cabbage, but non-chemical practices (mulching, cultivation) were as effective as herbicides in controlling A. artemisiifolia. This weed was associated with reductions in cabbage size at all three sites. The results demonstrate that rotational crop schemes in conjunction with non-chemical management strategies can be effective in controlling weed infestations. Dry weather during the growing season prevented the development of white mold. However, cabbage quality was reduced by a rot caused by a species of Fusarium.

Four field studies were conducted at the Huron Research Station, near Exeter, Ontario in 2012 and 2013. Commercially available synthetic fungicides and a biofungicide seed treatment were evaluated for efficacy in suppressing white mold of dry bean and a subsequent economic analysis was conducted. Area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated using disease intensity (incidenceÃ—severity) ratings. The untreated control and biofungicide seed treatment had the highest AUDPC values, and in addition to the two applications of the low rate of fluxapyroxadÂ +Â pyraclostrobin and two applications of penthiopyrad, had the lowest yields. The most efficacious products with regard to disease suppression and yield response were two applications of boscalid, all rates of fluazinam and thiophanate-methyl, and two applications of the high rate of fluopyramÂ +Â prothioconazole. Two applications of the high rate of fluazinam had the lowest AUDPC, which was nearly 60% lower than the untreated control.

Both SSR resistance and flowering time (FT) adaptation are major breeding goals in B. napus. However, early maturing rapeseed varieties, which are important for rice-rapeseed rotation in China, are often highly susceptible to SSR. Here, we found that SSR resistance was significantly negatively correlated with FT in a natural population containing 521 rapeseed inbred lines and a double haploid (DH) population with 150 individual lines, both of which had great variation in FT. Four chromosomal regions on A2, A6, C2, and C8 affecting both SSR resistance and FT were identified using quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping after constructing a high-density genetic map based on single nucleotide polymorphism markers in the DH population. Furthermore, we aligned QTL for the two traits identified in the present and previous studies to the B. napus reference genome, and identified four colocalized QTL hotspots of SSR resistance and FT on A2 (0â€“7.7â€¯Mb), A3 (0.8â€“7.5â€¯Mb), C2 (0â€“15.2â€¯Mb), and C6 (20.2â€“36.6â€¯Mb).

Application of sirolimus markedly increased activity of Î²-N-acetyl hexosaminidase, endochitinase and Î² -1,3-glucanase in plant leaves. Moreover, a significant increase was observed in the level of polyphenoloxidase and peroxidase in plant leaves two and four days after application of sirolimus. The results of in vitro tests showed that sirolimus at the concentration of 100â€¯nM completely inhibited disease severity. The treatment with sirolimus enhanced relative conductivity of S. sclerotiorum mycelia over time compared with control. An increase of carbohydrate leakage was observed in the pathogen mycelia incubated with sirolimus. The content of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) markedly increased at 5â€¯h and the highest MDA content was observed after 20â€¯h.

In contrast to the conventional application technique, dropleg nozzles are kept below the flowering canopy to restrict the exposure of pollinators to active ingredients of insecticides. The Julius KÃ¼hn-Institut (JKI) tested the efficacy of different insecticides using the dropleg technique compared to the conventional technique, on insect pests in field trials conducted from 2015 to 2017 in the area of Braunschweig. The crop was treated at full flowering (BBCH 65) for three consecutive years.

The superoxide ion is an important intermediate in the generation of ROS having a key regulatory function during plantâ€“microbe interactions and is an important component in fungal development. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) family contributes to frontline defense via detoxification of reactive superoxide radical anions. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen with a broad host range. S.Â sclerotiorum produces the non-specific phytotoxin and key pathogenicity factor, oxalic acid (OA). We have identified an S.Â sclerotiorum SOD (Sssod1) with high similarity to CuZnSODs. Sssod1 contains an open reading frame of 908Â bp in length and is predicted to encode a protein of 155 amino acids that harbors the entire hallmark motifs associated with SOD function. Treatment with the CuZnSOD inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC) resulted in delayed hyphal growth and sclerotial development in a dose-dependent manner. Mutants generated carrying an Sssod1 deletion (Î”Sssod1) exhibited morphological defects similar to those observed with the inhibitor treatment. Moreover, Î”Sssod1 was more sensitive than wild-type to menadione, a redox cycling agent. Expression of Sssod1 was induced following treatment with oxidizing agents and during interaction with plant host tissue the Î”Sssod1 mutant was significantly reduced in virulence on both tomato and tobacco plants compared to wild-type. Interestingly, pathogenicity of the superoxide dismutase mutant was mostly restored following supplementation with oxalate. We also observed that Î”Sssod1 was reduced in oxalate production by half. In accordance with reduced virulence, Î”Sssod1 induced a host oxidative burst in adjacent uninfected cells, a phenotype indicative of active pathogen recognition by the host.

Considering the diversity of biologically active substances, including those growth-promoting and stabilizing various pathogens contained in extracts, composts have a large potential to successfully replace the massively used pesticides. The effect of various concentrations of water compost extracts with the addition of polymers obtained from thermoplastic corn starch and polyethylene on the linear growth, biomass, and sporulation of the following polyphagous fungi was assessed under in situ and in vitro conditions: Fusarium culmorum (W.G. Smith), Fusarium graminearum Schwabe, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary, Rhizoctonia solani KÃ¼hn, Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissler. The studies revealed that the fungistatic activity was determined by the kind and concentration of compost extract added to the medium, as well as by the fungus kind. The analyzed compost extracts blocked the linear growth of the tested fungi on average by 22%, biomass increment by 51%, and sporulation by 57%. F. culmorum and S. sclerotiorum proved to be the most sensitive to the tested compost extracts. It was found that the extract from compost with the addition of polymer with the highest share of polyethylene blocked the sporulation of F. culmorum by 87% and F. graminearum by 92%. In turn, composts with the addition of polymers with the highest share of a biocomponent weakened the fungistatic activity of composts. The authors demonstrated that the addition of microbiological inoculum to one of the composts enhanced the fungistatic activity with respect to S. sclerotiorum, F. graminearum, and F. culmorum. The obtained results can be used to better understand the growth-promoting and suppression effects of compost extracts with polymer addition, help to enhance crop production, and constitute a paradigm shift towards the development of the next generation of compost with applications in a range of new fields.","2018-09-01","2021-01-12 07:35:53","2021-01-12 07:35:53",NA,"1063-1075",NA,NA,635,NA,"Science of The Total Environment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Phytopathogenic fungi; Compost extracts; Linear growth; Polymer materials; Sporulation; Trace elements",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Experiments were conducted at 2 sites, a Gray Luvisol (Typic Cryoboralf) and a Dark Gray Luvisol (Mollic Cryboralf) over 5 years in northeast Saskatchewan, Canada, with treatments of: zero (ZT) and conventional (CT) tillage, and burning (B) or no burning (NB) of previous crop residue. At each site, an experiment for barley and another for canola was established in a 2-year barleyâ€“canola rotation. Severity of leaf spotting diseases of barley, mainly net blotch [Pyrenophora teres Drechsler], and incidence of sclerotinia stem rot [Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary] of canola were sometimes greater in the B treatment than the NB. Leaf spot severity of barley was usually slightly reduced under CT compared with ZT, but regardless of severity, barley yields were either similar, or more often higher under ZT than CT (337â€“766kghaâˆ’1 or 11â€“57%). There were occasionally effects of B on barley yield, but results were inconsistent and sometimes depended on tillage system. Canola yield tended to be greater under ZT than CT (141â€“233kghaâˆ’1 or 9â€“44%), but the effect of B was inconsistent. Tillage system had the greatest impact on crop yields with higher yield more often under ZT than CT, most likely as a result of improved soil moisture under the ZT system.

By growing wild-type isolates on potato dextrose agar (PDA) containing sublethal concentrations of the fungicide, we obtained four fludioxonil-resistant mutants with resistance factors (EC50 resistant/EC50 sensitive phenotypes) >2000. The laboratory fludioxonil mutants were less fitter than their parental isolates in terms of mycelial radial growth, pathogenicity and sclerotial production. Moreover, on PDA amended with NaCl, the laboratory fludioxonil mutants grew more slowly than their fludioxonil-sensitive parents, especially at lower concentrations of NaCl. According to the fitness of mutants and the cross-resistance between fludioxonil and dicarboximide fungicides, phenylpyrroles can be considered to pose a moderate resistance risk.

This study was conducted to evaluate the inhibitory effect of sirolimus, a natural macrolide compound, against white rot of mustard tuber caused by S. sclerotiorum in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that sirolimus was able to reduce the mycelial growth, sclerogenesis as well as myceliogenic and carpogenic germinations of three isolates of the pathogen. Application of sirolimus markedly increased activity of Î²-N-acetyl hexosaminidase, endochitinase and Î² -1,3-glucanase in plant leaves. Moreover, a significant increase was observed in the level of polyphenoloxidase and peroxidase in plant leaves two and four days after application of sirolimus. The results of in vitro tests showed that sirolimus at the concentration of 100â€¯nM completely inhibited disease severity. The treatment with sirolimus enhanced relative conductivity of S. sclerotiorum mycelia over time compared with control. An increase of carbohydrate leakage was observed in the pathogen mycelia incubated with sirolimus. The content of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) markedly increased at 5â€¯h and the highest MDA content was observed after 20â€¯h. Due to exposure to sirolimus, a decrease percentage of catalase activity was observed in pathogen mycelia.

It can infect a wide variety of plants, causing serious disease in many types of crops, such as rapeseed, sunflower and soybean. Sclerotinia stem rot caused by this fungus affects main crops and has led to great economic loss. Elicitors are a group of compounds that inspire the host plant to produce an immune response against invading pathogens. This study describes a protein that has high homology with the Trichoderma elicitor Sm1 and was found in the genome of S. sclerotiorum. We named this protein SsSm1. To determine whether this protein has an elicitor function like its homology protein, we constructed a heterologous expression vector for SsSm1 and expressed it in Escherichia coli. The protein of heterologous expression led to the formation of lesions in tobacco that closely resemble hypersensitive response lesions. Transient expression of the encoding gene of SsSm1 in tobacco leaves also caused hypersensitive response. Then, RNA silencing was used to identify the function of SsSm1. The hyphal growth and pathogenicity of silenced transformants were shown to be obviously lagging and branched abnormally. Transformants produced less infection cushions and deformed sclerotiorum. In addition, SsSm1 silencing caused weak tolerance to NaCl, sorbitol and SDS, and the sensitivity of mutants to carbendazim was also significantly decreased. Based on the above results, we speculate that this protein may be related to the development of hyphae, infection cushions and sclerotiorum, but the specific molecular mechanism needs to be studied further.","2018-05-01","2021-01-12 07:35:32","2021-01-12 07:35:32",NA,"37-46",NA,NA,270,NA,"Plant Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"(Lib.) de Bary; Cerato-platanin; Elicitor; HR; RNAi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The superoxide ion is an important intermediate in the generation of ROS having a key regulatory function during plantâ€“microbe interactions and is an important component in fungal development. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) family contributes to frontline defense via detoxification of reactive superoxide radical anions. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen with a broad host range. S.Â sclerotiorum produces the non-specific phytotoxin and key pathogenicity factor, oxalic acid (OA). We have identified an S.Â sclerotiorum SOD (Sssod1) with high similarity to CuZnSODs. Sssod1 contains an open reading frame of 908Â bp in length and is predicted to encode a protein of 155 amino acids that harbors the entire hallmark motifs associated with SOD function. Treatment with the CuZnSOD inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC) resulted in delayed hyphal growth and sclerotial development in a dose-dependent manner. Mutants generated carrying an Sssod1 deletion (Î”Sssod1) exhibited morphological defects similar to those observed with the inhibitor treatment. Moreover, Î”Sssod1 was more sensitive than wild-type to menadione, a redox cycling agent. Expression of Sssod1 was induced following treatment with oxidizing agents and during interaction with plant host tissue the Î”Sssod1 mutant was significantly reduced in virulence on both tomato and tobacco plants compared to wild-type. Interestingly, pathogenicity of the superoxide dismutase mutant was mostly restored following supplementation with oxalate. We also observed that Î”Sssod1 was reduced in oxalate production by half. In accordance with reduced virulence, Î”Sssod1 induced a host oxidative burst in adjacent uninfected cells, a phenotype indicative of active pathogen recognition by the host. Intriguingly, during wild-type infection, host ROS production was significantly reduced. These results suggest that wild-type Sclerotinia suppresses host defense responses during infection.","2012-04-01","2021-01-12 07:35:33","2021-01-12 07:35:33",NA,"14-23",NA,NA,78,NA,"Physiological and Molecular Plant Pathology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reactive oxygen species; Oxalate; Oxidative stress tolerance; Superoxide dismutase",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Radial growth of mycelium was higher in isolates of mustard and eggplant from Pabna, marigold from Gazipur, country bean from Bogra and Hobigonj. Deep bright yellow color with higher luminosity values (35.58â€“36.84) was recorded in the isolates of mustard and eggplant from Pabna. Higher pH reduction (42.8%â€“50.6%) with changing of color from blue to yellow was recorded in the isolates of country bean in Bogra and, mustard and sunflower in Pabna. Oxalic acid production was higher in the isolates of mustard, Pabna (23.55â€¯mM) and weed, Bogra (21.54â€¯mM). Isolates of country bean, Bogra and eggplant, Ishordi produced 14.67â€¯mM and 13.40â€¯mM oxalic acid, respectively. The lowest oxalic acid (8.74â€¯mM) was produced in the isolate of marigold, Gazipur. Isolates of country bean in Hobigonj and Bogra, weed in Bogra and eggplant in Pabna developed symptoms size 4.62â€“7.78â€¯cm on country bean leaves. Severe infection and rapidly developing symptoms (5.00â€“9.00â€¯cm) were observed on eggplant leaves when the isolates of country bean in Hobigonj and Bogra, marigold in Gazipur, sunflower and eggplant in Pabna were inoculated. All seven isolates infected and produced symptoms on marigold leaves; however the size of symptoms varied. While ten isolates were examined for melanin synthesis in PDA media, all isolates produced melanin except the ones collected from Pabna regardless of crops. Isolates differed significantly for mycelial growth, media luminosity and pathogenicity. A positive correlation was found between mycelial growth and luminosity values, between mycelial dry weight and media pH and oxalic acid productions. Isolates also varied in relation to the time required to produce visible symptoms on the host plants.","2019-10-01","2021-01-12 07:39:04","2021-01-12 07:39:04",NA,"104849",NA,NA,124,NA,"Crop Protection",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Pathogenicity; Oxalic acid; pH; Isolates; Melanin; Variation; White mold disease",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of our research was to use a spring oilseed rape variety sown in autumn or an early-flowering variety of winter oilseed rape to predict the infection pressure of S.Â sclerotiorum in a given year. Field experiments were conducted in 2008â€“2012 at the experimental station of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague at ÄŒervenÃ½ Ãšjezd, 20Â km west of Prague. In the experiment, we used one variety of spring oilseed rape (LuÅ¾nice, LU) and one early-flowering variety of winter oilseed rape (Californium, CA). The methodology of the petal test involved isolating pathogenic fungi from fallen petals on a nutrient medium (potato dextrose agar) in Petri dishes. The first term of collection was the beginning of petal fall (BBCH 61) and the last term was the end of flowering (BBCH 69). The dishes with petals were visually analysed after 1 week. The results were compared with the actual occurrence of white mould of rape in the stand. The occurrence of white mould of rape was strongly influenced by the progress of weather conditions over the given year. Infected petals and stems with symptoms of white mould of rape were found to be moderately correlated (rÂ =Â 0.80). Spread of white mould spores was mostly observed in two terms (BBCH 62 and BBCH 65). Statistically significant differences were not observed in the infection of petals of spring (LU) and winter (CA) oilseed rape. Spring oilseed rape (LU) and early-flowering varieties of winter oilseed rape (CA) can be used to determine the strength of infection pressure of S.Â sclerotiorum in the stand in a given year, thereby improving protection against white mould of rape.","2016-02-01","2021-01-12 07:39:04","2021-01-12 07:39:04",NA,"127-131",NA,NA,80,NA,"Crop Protection",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Diagnostics; Petal test; Spring rapeseed; White mould of rape; Winter rapeseed",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Initials are formed in close proximity and several initials coalesce to form one sclerotium. Initials of the smaller-type sclerotium develop in positions lateral to the main hyphae by the repeated branching, interweaving and frequent anastomoses of short aerial hyphae. This is a simple type of development from strands. Initials are not normally formed in close proximity and coalescence of hyphal aggregates is less frequent. Small hyphal aggregates which developed into rounded spore-like cells were produced by all isolates. The differences between the two sclerotium types are due to the growth patterns of the mycelia of the two groups. The ontogenetic diversity suggests taxonomie differences between them.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the mycelial morphology and protein profile of S. sclerotiorum after exposure to VOCs produced by six Trichoderma strains. The assays were performed in the laboratory using inverted plate tests with evaluation of mycelial growth inhibition, microscopic observation of hyphae and MALDI-TOF analysis of S. sclerotiorum protein profile. The best results were obtained from T. azevedoi CEN1241, with up to 35% inhibition of mycelial growth and the greatest inhibitory effect on the production of differential proteins present in S. sclerotiorum control treatment. All tested Trichoderma strains decreased the width of the pathogenâ€™s hyphae.

Carrots were stored in five different atmospheres: high relative humidity (HRA), unadjusted cold room atmosphere (RA), and three atmospheres with modified CO2 and O2 concentrations (referred to as A, B and C). Containers fitted with silicone membranes of varying surface areas were used to maintain these atmospheres. Carrots in one-half of the containers were inoculated with S. sclerotiorum. The experiment was carried out in a cold room maintained at 1Â°C and was terminated after 6 months. The mean CO2/O2 percentages for modified atmospheres were 1.17/14.19, 1.52/12.11, 3.03/4.57, 3.81/3.73, 4.26/4.47 and 6.09/3.03% for treatments A1, B1, C1 (carrots without inoculum), A2, B2 and C2 (carrots with inoculum), respectively.

Carrots of treatments HRA1, A1, B1 and C1 (carrots without inoculum) were kept for evaluation by a taste panel and quality assessment. Taste panel evaluation indicated that carrots from treatment C1 were superior to store-bought carrots and carrots from other treatments. Quality assessment indicated that work (defined as load versus blade displacement when carrots were cut with an Instron apparatus) was significantly greater for HRA1 as compared to the other treatments and that modulus (defined as the slope of the curve of force versus the distance travelled during the cut) was significantly higher for C1 than HRA1 and RA1.

The results showed that sirolimus was able to reduce the mycelial growth, sclerogenesis as well as myceliogenic and carpogenic germinations of three isolates of the pathogen. Application of sirolimus markedly increased activity of Î²-N-acetyl hexosaminidase, endochitinase and Î² -1,3-glucanase in plant leaves. Moreover, a significant increase was observed in the level of polyphenoloxidase and peroxidase in plant leaves two and four days after application of sirolimus. The results of in vitro tests showed that sirolimus at the concentration of 100â€¯nM completely inhibited disease severity. The treatment with sirolimus enhanced relative conductivity of S. sclerotiorum mycelia over time compared with control. An increase of carbohydrate leakage was observed in the pathogen mycelia incubated with sirolimus. The content of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) markedly increased at 5â€¯h and the highest MDA content was observed after 20â€¯h.

No cultivars planted in South Africa have been screened for the presence of these QTLs and their underlying markers, and limited current information on the resistance of these cultivars is available. A detached leaf assay was used to assess resistance of 29 soybean cultivars that are commercially grown in South Africa at temperatures of 20â€¯Â°C and 25â€¯Â°C as well as under low and high relative humidity. These cultivars were further screened for resistance to Sclerotinia stem rot using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, that are linked to resistance traits associated with Sclerotinia stem rot in soybean. Detached leaf assays revealed a significant difference (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.001) in disease response across tested cultivars, while SSR markers revealed 10 cultivars that potentially have genetic-based resistance against Sclerotinia stem rot. Cultivars that showed a level of resistance to infection during the detached leaf assay were also more closely related to the Sclerotinia stem rot resistant cultivar Maple Arrow than to highly susceptible cultivar Williams 82; indicating the possible genetic resistance of these cultivars to Sclerotinia stem rot.","2019-11-01","2021-01-12 07:39:08","2021-01-12 07:39:08",NA,"104909",NA,NA,125,NA,"Crop Protection",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Cultivar screening; Detached leaf assay; Quantitative trait loci; Sclerotinia stem rot; Simple sequence repeat markers; Soybean",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In contrast to the conventional application technique, dropleg nozzles are kept below the flowering canopy to restrict the exposure of pollinators to active ingredients of insecticides. The Julius KÃ¼hn-Institut (JKI) tested the efficacy of different insecticides using the dropleg technique compared to the conventional technique, on insect pests in field trials conducted from 2015 to 2017 in the area of Braunschweig. The crop was treated at full flowering (BBCH 65) for three consecutive years. The tested insecticides were Biscaya (72â€¯g a. i. haâˆ’1 thiacloprid), Mavrik (48â€¯g a. i. haâˆ’1 tau-fluvalinate), and Mospilan SG (40â€¯g a. i. haâˆ’1 acetamiprid). The adults and larvae of oilseed rape pests that drop to the ground were collected using water trays. The emergence of new generation beetles (Brassicogethes aeneus (Fabricius), C. obstrictus) was recorded from BBCH 78 onwards, using photoeclectors. At least twice during each season, oilseed rape plants were assessed for D. brassicae injury. The new dropleg application technique showed similar efficacy on pest insects compared to the conventional spraying technique. Nevertheless, the abundance of pests was not always sufficient to get clear results. Results especially on D. brassicae indicate that the dropleg technique had a comparable efficacy under moderate pest pressure conditions observed in our study. Further research under conditions with a higher abundance of C. obstrictus, as well as research on the effects of dropleg technique on parasitoids of oilseed rape pests, is needed. The population of B. aeneus population was reduced slightly less using dropleg instead of conventional application technique.

The superoxide ion is an important intermediate in the generation of ROS having a key regulatory function during plantâ€“microbe interactions and is an important component in fungal development. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) family contributes to frontline defense via detoxification of reactive superoxide radical anions. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen with a broad host range. S.Â sclerotiorum produces the non-specific phytotoxin and key pathogenicity factor, oxalic acid (OA). We have identified an S.Â sclerotiorum SOD (Sssod1) with high similarity to CuZnSODs. Sssod1 contains an open reading frame of 908Â bp in length and is predicted to encode a protein of 155 amino acids that harbors the entire hallmark motifs associated with SOD function. Treatment with the CuZnSOD inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC) resulted in delayed hyphal growth and sclerotial development in a dose-dependent manner. Mutants generated carrying an Sssod1 deletion (Î”Sssod1) exhibited morphological defects similar to those observed with the inhibitor treatment. Moreover, Î”Sssod1 was more sensitive than wild-type to menadione, a redox cycling agent. Expression of Sssod1 was induced following treatment with oxidizing agents and during interaction with plant host tissue the Î”Sssod1 mutant was significantly reduced in virulence on both tomato and tobacco plants compared to wild-type. Interestingly, pathogenicity of the superoxide dismutase mutant was mostly restored following supplementation with oxalate. We also observed that Î”Sssod1 was reduced in oxalate production by half. In accordance with reduced virulence, Î”Sssod1 induced a host oxidative burst in adjacent uninfected cells, a phenotype indicative of active pathogen recognition by the host. Intriguingly, during wild-type infection, host ROS production was significantly reduced. These results suggest that wild-type Sclerotinia suppresses host defense responses during infection.","2012-04-01","2021-01-12 07:39:10","2021-01-12 07:39:10",NA,"14-23",NA,NA,78,NA,"Physiological and Molecular Plant Pathology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Reactive oxygen species; Oxalate; Oxidative stress tolerance; Superoxide dismutase",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In an initial investigation, A. siro was found to transmit the mycoparasite from infected to uninfected sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum in moist sterile sand and non-sterile soil. Subsequently, a simple assay system to monitor transfer of C. minitans from colonised wheat grains to uninfected sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum was developed. Both A. siro and F. candida transmitted C. minitans at least 55mm to sclerotia in soil at water potentials ranging from saturation to âˆ’3.6MPa. Transmission by A. siro was greater in drier conditions (âˆ’0.25 to âˆ’3.6MPa) as mites survived poorly in saturated soil. However, water potentials between saturation to âˆ’3.6MPa had no effect on transmission by F. candida, although collembolans died after 18d at water potentials of âˆ’5.4MPa or drier. Generally, maximum dispersal occurred within 2weeks. In soil lacking added arthropods, negligible spread of the mycoparasite was observed.

The non-injury method of screening technique involves stem inoculation using a five days old mycelial mat on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plug placed on the top of sterile water-soaked cotton pad firmly wrapped over the internodal region with parafilm at the basal portion of the stem (15â€“20Â cm above the ground) in the field. Inoculation without injury substantiates the natural means of infection in the field and the use of moist cotton pad keeps humidity for longer to initiate infection even in case of adverse climatic conditions. Disease development on the inoculated stem was measured by the length and width of the lesion. The symptom appears with water-soaked lesion formation and spreading deeper and wider on the stem in >90% of inoculated plants. During the experiment, about 800 Brassica germplasms including their wild relatives were screened and evaluated for three consecutive years using near-natural (non-injury) method of disease inoculation in the field.

Considering the diversity of biologically active substances, including those growth-promoting and stabilizing various pathogens contained in extracts, composts have a large potential to successfully replace the massively used pesticides. The effect of various concentrations of water compost extracts with the addition of polymers obtained from thermoplastic corn starch and polyethylene on the linear growth, biomass, and sporulation of the following polyphagous fungi was assessed under in situ and in vitro conditions: Fusarium culmorum (W.G. Smith), Fusarium graminearum Schwabe, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary, Rhizoctonia solani KÃ¼hn, Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissler. The studies revealed that the fungistatic activity was determined by the kind and concentration of compost extract added to the medium, as well as by the fungus kind. The analyzed compost extracts blocked the linear growth of the tested fungi on average by 22%, biomass increment by 51%, and sporulation by 57%. F. culmorum and S. sclerotiorum proved to be the most sensitive to the tested compost extracts. It was found that the extract from compost with the addition of polymer with the highest share of polyethylene blocked the sporulation of F. culmorum by 87% and F. graminearum by 92%. In turn, composts with the addition of polymers with the highest share of a biocomponent weakened the fungistatic activity of composts. The authors demonstrated that the addition of microbiological inoculum to one of the composts enhanced the fungistatic activity with respect to S. sclerotiorum, F. graminearum, and F. culmorum.

The new methods have allowed to receive new hybrids with cytoplasms of brussel sprout, curly leaf kale, and pasture cabbage. New forms of winter rapeseed have been obtained, which are more resistant to frost and fungal pathogens like Leptosphaeria maculans (Desm.) Ces. et de Not., conidial stage Phoma lingam (Tode ex Fr.)

The sexual cycle produces apothecia required for inoculum dispersal. In this study, insight into the regulation of apothecial multicellular development was pursued through functional characterization of mating-type genes. These genes are hypothesized to encode master regulatory proteins required for aspects of sexual development ranging from fertilization through fertile fruiting body development. Experimentally, loss-of-function mutants were created for the conserved core mating-type genes (MAT1-1-1, and MAT1-2-1), and the lineage-specific genes found only in S. sclerotiorum and closely related fungi (MAT1-1-5, and MAT1-2-4). The MAT1-1-1, MAT1-1-5, and MAT1-2-1 mutants are able to form ascogonia but are blocked in all aspects of apothecium development. These mutants also exhibit defects in secondary sexual characters including lower numbers of spermatia. The MAT1-2-4 mutants are delayed in carpogenic germination accompanied with altered disc morphogenesis and ascospore production. They too produce lower numbers of spermatia. All four MAT gene mutants showed alterations in the expression of putative pheromone precursor (Ppg-1) and pheromone receptor (PreA, PreB) genes.

The median effective concentration (EC50) values for inhibition of mycelial growth of 78 S.Â sclerotiorum strains ranged from 5.46 to 29.34Â Î¼g/ml, with an average EC50 value of 17.36Â Â±Â 2.28Â Î¼g/ml. Meanwhile, both in pot experiments and on detached leaves, cuminic acid exhibited significant control effects against S.Â sclerotiorum. After treated with cuminic acid, mycelia were clustered seriously and the surface were collapsed and shriveled. In S.Â sclerotiorum, cell membrane permeability would be increased while oxalic acid content would be decreased and glycerol content would be increased significantly treated with cuminic acid. Above all, cuminic acid showed the potential as a natural alternative to commercial fungicides or a lead compound to develop new fungicides for the control of Sclerotinia stem rot.","2017-11-01","2021-01-12 07:39:20","2021-01-12 07:39:20",NA,"76-83",NA,NA,101,NA,"Crop Protection",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Disease management; Sclerotinia stem rot; Botanical fungicide; p-isopropyl benzoic acid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The activities of these enzymes determine the pathogenicity/ virulence and are crucial for the colonization on plant tissues. PGs can induce defense reactions in plants unrelated to its enzyme activities. To understand the PG signaling pathway, a PG gene was cloned from S. sclerotiorum by RT-PCR. The encoding region of the PG gene was fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain in yeast expression vector PGBKT7 and a rapeseed (B. napus) cDNA expression library was constructed in yeast. PG-interacting proteins were screened in the library using PG as bait by yeast two-hybrid assay. An interacting protein was isolated. Sequencing and BLAST analysis revealed that the protein contained a C2-domain and was predicted to be a Ca2+ binding domain. The protein shared 80.24% identity in amino acids with a C2-domain protein in Arabidopsis with unknown function. The expression levels of the C2-domain protein in floral, leaf, and stem organs of oilseed rape were investigated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The C2-domain protein was highly expressed in leaves when inoculated with S. sclerotiorum.

Cabbage sub-plots were established on larger whole-plots which had been under rotations of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), clover (Trifolium pratense L.), rye (Secale cereale L.) or sweet corn (Zea mays L. var. rugosa Bonaf.) for the two previous years. Weed densities were measured 21d after cabbage transplanting. Weed community response to the rotational crops varied by location. In general, herbicides provided the best weed control in cabbage, but non-chemical practices (mulching, cultivation) were as effective as herbicides in controlling A. artemisiifolia. This weed was associated with reductions in cabbage size at all three sites. The results demonstrate that rotational crop schemes in conjunction with non-chemical management strategies can be effective in controlling weed infestations. Dry weather during the growing season prevented the development of white mold. However, cabbage quality was reduced by a rot caused by a species of Fusarium.

To facilitate this work, a novel method for surface sterilising mites was developed. In an initial investigation, A. siro was found to carry inoculum externally and in the gut. Indeed, almost all faecal pellets collected from either A. siro or F. candida, following feeding on C. minitans, contained germinable inoculum of the mycoparasite. Microscopic examination showed that faeces from these animals consisted mainly of conidia or fragments of conidium, but that only intact conidia gave rise to growth of C. minitans. Passage through the gut of either animal reduced percentage germination of conidia to 11 and 60% in mite and collembolan faeces, respectively, compared to 99% in controls not subjected to gut passage. In addition, germination in mite faeces was delayed by approximately 12h compared to controls. However, subsequent germ tube extension from surviving conidia appeared unaffected by gut passage.

It can infect a wide variety of plants, causing serious disease in many types of crops, such as rapeseed, sunflower and soybean. Sclerotinia stem rot caused by this fungus affects main crops and has led to great economic loss. Elicitors are a group of compounds that inspire the host plant to produce an immune response against invading pathogens. This study describes a protein that has high homology with the Trichoderma elicitor Sm1 and was found in the genome of S. sclerotiorum. We named this protein SsSm1. To determine whether this protein has an elicitor function like its homology protein, we constructed a heterologous expression vector for SsSm1 and expressed it in Escherichia coli. The protein of heterologous expression led to the formation of lesions in tobacco that closely resemble hypersensitive response lesions. Transient expression of the encoding gene of SsSm1 in tobacco leaves also caused hypersensitive response. Then, RNA silencing was used to identify the function of SsSm1. The hyphal growth and pathogenicity of silenced transformants were shown to be obviously lagging and branched abnormally. Transformants produced less infection cushions and deformed sclerotiorum. In addition, SsSm1 silencing caused weak tolerance to NaCl, sorbitol and SDS, and the sensitivity of mutants to carbendazim was also significantly decreased. Based on the above results, we speculate that this protein may be related to the development of hyphae, infection cushions and sclerotiorum, but the specific molecular mechanism needs to be studied further.","2018-05-01","2021-01-12 07:39:25","2021-01-12 07:39:25",NA,"37-46",NA,NA,270,NA,"Plant Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"(Lib.) de Bary; Cerato-platanin; Elicitor; HR; RNAi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To alleviate this problem, a system for the uniform application of high-temperature short-duration steam disinfection was developed using accurate real-time temperature monitoring of individual produce segments by thermal imaging. Uniform short-duration high-temperature heat was delivered from above by steam jets combined with electric steam-drying elements and reflectors. Produce was subjected to rotational and linear motions to expose each surface segment to the same amount of heat. The novel use of thermal imaging to monitor surface temperature in steam systems was essential for determining transferred heat and heating uniformity in a treated object. The resultant, uniform application of short-duration high-temperature steam provided surface heat-disinfection with minimal internal heating and damage. Application of the steam treatment immediately after carrot hydro-cooling reduced post-storage phytotoxic color change by 60â€“80% and resulted in significantly reduced sensitivity to post-storage soft rots caused by S. sclerotiorum. Carrot sprouting was not increased by the steam treatment, suggesting retention of the hydro-cooling's physiological effect. These results suggest that precise heat treatment can be optimally applied after hydro-cooling to improve postharvest quality of carrots in a procedure that is harmless to man and the environment.","2011-03-01","2021-01-12 07:39:26","2021-01-12 07:39:26",NA,"265-271",NA,3,59,NA,"Postharvest Biology and Technology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Carrot; Hydro-cooling; Postharvest disease; Steam; Thermal imaging",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Producers often require fungicides to control moderate to high disease levels. Evaluation of fungicide efficacy and cost is critical to make cognisant management decisions. Four field studies were conducted at the Huron Research Station, near Exeter, Ontario in 2012 and 2013. Commercially available synthetic fungicides and a biofungicide seed treatment were evaluated for efficacy in suppressing white mold of dry bean and a subsequent economic analysis was conducted. Area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated using disease intensity (incidenceÃ—severity) ratings. The untreated control and biofungicide seed treatment had the highest AUDPC values, and in addition to the two applications of the low rate of fluxapyroxadÂ +Â pyraclostrobin and two applications of penthiopyrad, had the lowest yields. The most efficacious products with regard to disease suppression and yield response were two applications of boscalid, all rates of fluazinam and thiophanate-methyl, and two applications of the high rate of fluopyramÂ +Â prothioconazole. Two applications of the high rate of fluazinam had the lowest AUDPC, which was nearly 60% lower than the untreated control. Two applications of the high rate of thiophanate-methyl was the highest yielding treatment, recovering 70% of yield lost from untreated plots. Economic impacts varied with planting dates. For the first planting, profit margins for all fungicide treatments, with the exception of two applications of penthiopyrad, two applications of the low rate of fluxapyroxadÂ +Â pyraclostrobin, and the biofungicide seed treatment, were significantly greater than the untreated control.

To investigate the role of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) in defending dry bean plants against S. sclerotiorum, we used suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) of cDNA and identified genes that are differentially expressed during plantâ€“pathogen interactions after treatment. Exogenous MeJA application enhanced resistance to the pathogen, and SSH analyses led to the identification of 94 unigenes, presumably involved in a variety of functions, which were classified into several functional categories, including metabolism, signal transduction, protein biogenesis and degradation, and cell defense and rescue. Using RTâ€“qPCR, some unigenes were found to be differentially expressed in a time-dependent manner in dry bean plants during the interaction with S. sclerotiorum after MeJA treatment, including the pathogenesis-related protein PR3 (chitinase), PvCallose (callose synthase), PvNBS-LRR (NBS-LRR resistance-like protein), PvF-box (F-box family protein-like), and a polygalacturonase inhibitor protein (PGIP). Based on these expression data, the putative roles of differentially expressed genes were discussed in relation to the disease and MeJA resistance induction. Changes in the activity of the pathogenesis-related proteins Î²-1,3-glucanase, chitinase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and peroxidase in plants after MeJA treatment and following inoculation of the pathogen were also investigated as molecular markers of induced resistance. Foliar application of MeJA induced partial resistance against S. sclerotiorum in plants as well as a consistent increase in pathogenesis-related protein activities.

Adding tricyclazole, a polyketide melanin pathway inhibitor, to Difco PDA reduced the production of DHN and sclerin by SS7 compared to control treatments in the late but not in the early stages of growth. Increasing concentrations of tricyclazole were marginally more effective at reducing DHN biosynthesis but were incrementally more inhibitory to sclerin production. Tricyclazole, even at 50 ppm, only slightly inhibited fungal growth and did not prevent the production of melanin. In contrast, SS7 cultures grown on PDA from BDH Inc. produced less than 10% of the amount of sclerin found with Difco medium and DHN was present only in trace or undetectable amounts. The medium used for culturing SS7 thus had a more significant impact on production of excreted polyketides than tricyclazole.

Morphological and melanization aspects during sclerotial development were evaluated by microscopy and qRT-PCR techniques. S. sclerotiorum produces sclerotia with different phases of maturation and melanization during growth in PDA medium. Using scanning electron microscopy we observed that there are no structural differences in the three stages of formation of melanized and non-melanized sclerotium. Through histochemical analysis we observed that the melanized sclerotium accumulates more glycogen and produces less protein than non-melanized sclerotia. Melanin was most commonly found in the rind of melanized sclerotia, and the highest concentration of lipofucsins was found in non-melanized sclerotia. These molecules are products of the lipid peroxidation pathway and are associated with oxidative stress during differentiation in fungi. The expression of histidine kinase (shk) and adenylate cyclase (sac) genes in melanized and non-melanized sclerotiawere also evaluated. The higher gene expression of shk and lesser expression of sac in non-melanized sclerotiais an indication of the participation of cell signaling in the development of these structures. The higher expression of polyketide synthase (pks), tyrosinase (tyr) and laccase (lac) in non-melanized sclerotia suggested that S. sclerotiorum can use the DHN and L-dopa pathways to produce melanin. Expression studies of the enzymes chitin synthase and glucan synthase suggest that this process occurs along with the formation of melanin.

Towards this end, the inhibitory activities and metabolism of the cruciferous phytoalexins camalexin, brassinin, cyclobrassinin, and brassilexin by the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea Pers.

This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that burning crop residues reduces the severity of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and canola (Brassica napus L.) diseases, and increases seed or grain yield or quality. Experiments were conducted at 2 sites, a Gray Luvisol (Typic Cryoboralf) and a Dark Gray Luvisol (Mollic Cryboralf) over 5 years in northeast Saskatchewan, Canada, with treatments of: zero (ZT) and conventional (CT) tillage, and burning (B) or no burning (NB) of previous crop residue. At each site, an experiment for barley and another for canola was established in a 2-year barleyâ€“canola rotation. Severity of leaf spotting diseases of barley, mainly net blotch [Pyrenophora teres Drechsler], and incidence of sclerotinia stem rot [Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary] of canola were sometimes greater in the B treatment than the NB. Leaf spot severity of barley was usually slightly reduced under CT compared with ZT, but regardless of severity, barley yields were either similar, or more often higher under ZT than CT (337â€“766kghaâˆ’1 or 11â€“57%). There were occasionally effects of B on barley yield, but results were inconsistent and sometimes depended on tillage system. Canola yield tended to be greater under ZT than CT (141â€“233kghaâˆ’1 or 9â€“44%), but the effect of B was inconsistent. Tillage system had the greatest impact on crop yields with higher yield more often under ZT than CT, most likely as a result of improved soil moisture under the ZT system.

Nine cyprodinil-resistant mutants (Range of resistance factor: 20.22â€“271.59) were obtained from sensitive strains exposed on PDA medium amended with cyprodinil and the resistance was stable after their ten transfers on PDA without the fungicide or stored at 4â€¯Â°C for two months.

Compared with the parental strains, all of the nine cyprodinil-resistant mutants decreased in sclerotial production. The dry weight of mycelia, pathogenicity and cell membrane permeability of most resistant mutants decreased. The mycelial growth, oxalic acid content, and the response to various stress for resistant mutants were almost the same as the sensitive parental strains. Sequencing alignment results showed that there was no alteration of amino acid in cystathionine Î³-synthase (MetB) and cystathionine Î²-lyase (MetC) between cyprodinil-resistant mutants and their sensitive parental strains, which indicated that MetB or MetC was not the molecular target of cyprodinil in S. sclerotiorum. The addition of amino acids L-methionine, L-cystine or L-cysteine decreased the inhibition of cyprodinil against mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum, which indicated that cyprodinil could not only inhibited methionine biosynthesis but also suppressed cystine and cysteine biosynthesis.

Positive cross-resistance was not detected between fludioxonil and benzimidazole fungicides but was detected between fludioxonil and dicarboximide fungicides which are considered as high resistance risk fungicides by FRAC, even though these fungicides have different molecular structures.

The laboratory fludioxonil mutants were less fitter than their parental isolates in terms of mycelial radial growth, pathogenicity and sclerotial production. Moreover, on PDA amended with NaCl, the laboratory fludioxonil mutants grew more slowly than their fludioxonil-sensitive parents, especially at lower concentrations of NaCl. According to the fitness of mutants and the cross-resistance between fludioxonil and dicarboximide fungicides, phenylpyrroles can be considered to pose a moderate resistance risk.

The activities of these enzymes determine the pathogenicity/ virulence and are crucial for the colonization on plant tissues. PGs can induce defense reactions in plants unrelated to its enzyme activities. To understand the PG signaling pathway, a PG gene was cloned from S. sclerotiorum by RT-PCR. The encoding region of the PG gene was fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain in yeast expression vector PGBKT7 and a rapeseed (B. napus) cDNA expression library was constructed in yeast. PG-interacting proteins were screened in the library using PG as bait by yeast two-hybrid assay. An interacting protein was isolated. Sequencing and BLAST analysis revealed that the protein contained a C2-domain and was predicted to be a Ca2+ binding domain. The protein shared 80.24% identity in amino acids with a C2-domain protein in Arabidopsis with unknown function. The expression levels of the C2-domain protein in floral, leaf, and stem organs of oilseed rape were investigated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The C2-domain protein was highly expressed in leaves when inoculated with S. sclerotiorum.

It can infect a wide variety of plants, causing serious disease in many types of crops, such as rapeseed, sunflower and soybean. Sclerotinia stem rot caused by this fungus affects main crops and has led to great economic loss. Elicitors are a group of compounds that inspire the host plant to produce an immune response against invading pathogens. This study describes a protein that has high homology with the Trichoderma elicitor Sm1 and was found in the genome of S. sclerotiorum. We named this protein SsSm1. To determine whether this protein has an elicitor function like its homology protein, we constructed a heterologous expression vector for SsSm1 and expressed it in Escherichia coli. The protein of heterologous expression led to the formation of lesions in tobacco that closely resemble hypersensitive response lesions. Transient expression of the encoding gene of SsSm1 in tobacco leaves also caused hypersensitive response. Then, RNA silencing was used to identify the function of SsSm1. The hyphal growth and pathogenicity of silenced transformants were shown to be obviously lagging and branched abnormally. Transformants produced less infection cushions and deformed sclerotiorum. In addition, SsSm1 silencing caused weak tolerance to NaCl, sorbitol and SDS, and the sensitivity of mutants to carbendazim was also significantly decreased. Based on the above results, we speculate that this protein may be related to the development of hyphae, infection cushions and sclerotiorum, but the specific molecular mechanism needs to be studied further.","2018-05-01","2021-01-12 07:34:28","2021-01-12 07:34:28",NA,"37-46",NA,NA,270,NA,"Plant Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"(Lib.) de Bary; Cerato-platanin; Elicitor; HR; RNAi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

S. sclerotiorum produces sclerotia with different phases of maturation and melanization during growth in PDA medium. Using scanning electron microscopy we observed that there are no structural differences in the three stages of formation of melanized and non-melanized sclerotium. Through histochemical analysis we observed that the melanized sclerotium accumulates more glycogen and produces less protein than non-melanized sclerotia. Melanin was most commonly found in the rind of melanized sclerotia, and the highest concentration of lipofucsins was found in non-melanized sclerotia. These molecules are products of the lipid peroxidation pathway and are associated with oxidative stress during differentiation in fungi. The expression of histidine kinase (shk) and adenylate cyclase (sac) genes in melanized and non-melanized sclerotiawere also evaluated. The higher gene expression of shk and lesser expression of sac in non-melanized sclerotiais an indication of the participation of cell signaling in the development of these structures. The higher expression of polyketide synthase (pks), tyrosinase (tyr) and laccase (lac) in non-melanized sclerotia suggested that S. sclerotiorum can use the DHN and L-dopa pathways to produce melanin.

This induction is observed as early as 2 days after infection in a tolerant line (PS3B), while it occurred only after 3 days in a susceptible one (HA89). It appears that the tolerance is associated to an early increase of extensin hybridizable RNA; steady state levels of these transcripts could be used as a molecular marker of sunflower tolerance to the stem base white mold. Oxalic acid, the major toxin produced by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, induces a differential accumulation of the same HRGP transcripts in the two lines, in an organo-specific way. Only the 1.6- and the 0.135-kb RNA species are representative of the tolerance of PS3B to both the toxin and the fungus.

The activities of these enzymes determine the pathogenicity/ virulence and are crucial for the colonization on plant tissues. PGs can induce defense reactions in plants unrelated to its enzyme activities. To understand the PG signaling pathway, a PG gene was cloned from S. sclerotiorum by RT-PCR. The encoding region of the PG gene was fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain in yeast expression vector PGBKT7 and a rapeseed (B. napus) cDNA expression library was constructed in yeast. PG-interacting proteins were screened in the library using PG as bait by yeast two-hybrid assay. An interacting protein was isolated. Sequencing and BLAST analysis revealed that the protein contained a C2-domain and was predicted to be a Ca2+ binding domain. The protein shared 80.24% identity in amino acids with a C2-domain protein in Arabidopsis with unknown function. The expression levels of the C2-domain protein in floral, leaf, and stem organs of oilseed rape were investigated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The C2-domain protein was highly expressed in leaves when inoculated with S. sclerotiorum.

The objective behind this study was to develop and evaluate a field-based non-injury method of inoculation technique for Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) in oilseed Brassica, caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary. The non-injury method of screening technique involves stem inoculation using a five days old mycelial mat on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plug placed on the top of sterile water-soaked cotton pad firmly wrapped over the internodal region with parafilm at the basal portion of the stem (15â€“20Â cm above the ground) in the field. Inoculation without injury substantiates the natural means of infection in the field and the use of moist cotton pad keeps humidity for longer to initiate infection even in case of adverse climatic conditions. Disease development on the inoculated stem was measured by the length and width of the lesion. The symptom appears with water-soaked lesion formation and spreading deeper and wider on the stem in >90% of inoculated plants. During the experiment, about 800 Brassica germplasms including their wild relatives were screened and evaluated for three consecutive years using near-natural (non-injury) method of disease inoculation in the field. The Inoculation severity index (ISI) obtained during these years at Pusa, New Delhi were significantly similar and correlated with the natural infection measured in terms of disease severity index (DSI) on selected germplasm in the sick plot at ICAR-DRMR, Bharatpur.

Sclerotinia stem rot caused by this fungus affects main crops and has led to great economic loss. Elicitors are a group of compounds that inspire the host plant to produce an immune response against invading pathogens. This study describes a protein that has high homology with the Trichoderma elicitor Sm1 and was found in the genome of S. sclerotiorum. We named this protein SsSm1. To determine whether this protein has an elicitor function like its homology protein, we constructed a heterologous expression vector for SsSm1 and expressed it in Escherichia coli. The protein of heterologous expression led to the formation of lesions in tobacco that closely resemble hypersensitive response lesions. Transient expression of the encoding gene of SsSm1 in tobacco leaves also caused hypersensitive response. Then, RNA silencing was used to identify the function of SsSm1. The hyphal growth and pathogenicity of silenced transformants were shown to be obviously lagging and branched abnormally. Transformants produced less infection cushions and deformed sclerotiorum. In addition, SsSm1 silencing caused weak tolerance to NaCl, sorbitol and SDS, and the sensitivity of mutants to carbendazim was also significantly decreased. Based on the above results, we speculate that this protein may be related to the development of hyphae, infection cushions and sclerotiorum, but the specific molecular mechanism needs to be studied further.","2018-05-01","2021-01-12 07:36:43","2021-01-12 07:36:43",NA,"37-46",NA,NA,270,NA,"Plant Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"(Lib.) de Bary; Cerato-platanin; Elicitor; HR; RNAi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Four field studies were conducted at the Huron Research Station, near Exeter, Ontario in 2012 and 2013. Commercially available synthetic fungicides and a biofungicide seed treatment were evaluated for efficacy in suppressing white mold of dry bean and a subsequent economic analysis was conducted. Area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated using disease intensity (incidenceÃ—severity) ratings. The untreated control and biofungicide seed treatment had the highest AUDPC values, and in addition to the two applications of the low rate of fluxapyroxadÂ +Â pyraclostrobin and two applications of penthiopyrad, had the lowest yields. The most efficacious products with regard to disease suppression and yield response were two applications of boscalid, all rates of fluazinam and thiophanate-methyl, and two applications of the high rate of fluopyramÂ +Â prothioconazole. Two applications of the high rate of fluazinam had the lowest AUDPC, which was nearly 60% lower than the untreated control. Two applications of the high rate of thiophanate-methyl was the highest yielding treatment, recovering 70% of yield lost from untreated plots. Economic impacts varied with planting dates.

This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that burning crop residues reduces the severity of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and canola (Brassica napus L.) diseases, and increases seed or grain yield or quality. Experiments were conducted at 2 sites, a Gray Luvisol (Typic Cryoboralf) and a Dark Gray Luvisol (Mollic Cryboralf) over 5 years in northeast Saskatchewan, Canada, with treatments of: zero (ZT) and conventional (CT) tillage, and burning (B) or no burning (NB) of previous crop residue. At each site, an experiment for barley and another for canola was established in a 2-year barleyâ€“canola rotation. Severity of leaf spotting diseases of barley, mainly net blotch [Pyrenophora teres Drechsler], and incidence of sclerotinia stem rot [Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary] of canola were sometimes greater in the B treatment than the NB. Leaf spot severity of barley was usually slightly reduced under CT compared with ZT, but regardless of severity, barley yields were either similar, or more often higher under ZT than CT (337â€“766kghaâˆ’1 or 11â€“57%). There were occasionally effects of B on barley yield, but results were inconsistent and sometimes depended on tillage system. Canola yield tended to be greater under ZT than CT (141â€“233kghaâˆ’1 or 9â€“44%), but the effect of B was inconsistent. Tillage system had the greatest impact on crop yields with higher yield more often under ZT than CT, most likely as a result of improved soil moisture under the ZT system. We conclude that use of fire to manage diseases of barley and canola is ineffective.","2010-08-01","2021-01-12 07:36:44","2021-01-12 07:36:44",NA,"153-160",NA,2,109,NA,"Soil and Tillage Research",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cereal diseases; Oilseeds diseases; Stubble management; Tillage practices",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Transgenic soybean plants were produced byAgrobacterium -mediated transformation with the wheat germin gene (gf-2.8) encoding an oligomeric protein, oxalate oxidase (OxO), which oxidizes oxalic acid to carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Transgenic soybean homozygous for 35S- gf-2.8 produced an approx. 130kDa protein indistinguishable from wheat germin, and with OxO activity.

Positive cross-resistance was not detected between fludioxonil and benzimidazole fungicides but was detected between fludioxonil and dicarboximide fungicides which are considered as high resistance risk fungicides by FRAC, even though these fungicides have different molecular structures. By growing wild-type isolates on potato dextrose agar (PDA) containing sublethal concentrations of the fungicide, we obtained four fludioxonil-resistant mutants with resistance factors (EC50 resistant/EC50 sensitive phenotypes) >2000. The laboratory fludioxonil mutants were less fitter than their parental isolates in terms of mycelial radial growth, pathogenicity and sclerotial production. Moreover, on PDA amended with NaCl, the laboratory fludioxonil mutants grew more slowly than their fludioxonil-sensitive parents, especially at lower concentrations of NaCl. According to the fitness of mutants and the cross-resistance between fludioxonil and dicarboximide fungicides, phenylpyrroles can be considered to pose a moderate resistance risk.

Species identification based on morphological characteristics is challenging and time demanding, especially when one crop hosts multiple species. The objective of this study was to design specific primers compatible with multiplexing, for rapid, sensitive and accurate detection and discrimination among four Sclerotinia species. Specific primers were designed for the aspartyl protease gene of S. sclerotiorum, the calmodulin gene of S. trifoliorum, the elongation factor-1 alpha gene of S. homoeocarpa, and the laccase 2 gene of S. minor. The specificity and sensitivity of each primer set was tested individually and in multiplex against isolates of each species and validated using genomic DNA from infected plants. Each primer set consistently amplified DNA of its target gene only. DNA fragments of different sizes were amplified: a 264bp PCR product for S. minor, a 218bp product for S. homoeocarpa, a 171bp product for S. sclerotiorum, and a 97bp product for S. trifoliorum. These primer sets can be used individually or in multiplex for identification of Sclerotinia spp. in pure culture or from infected plants.

The activities of these enzymes determine the pathogenicity/ virulence and are crucial for the colonization on plant tissues. PGs can induce defense reactions in plants unrelated to its enzyme activities. To understand the PG signaling pathway, a PG gene was cloned from S. sclerotiorum by RT-PCR. The encoding region of the PG gene was fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain in yeast expression vector PGBKT7 and a rapeseed (B. napus) cDNA expression library was constructed in yeast. PG-interacting proteins were screened in the library using PG as bait by yeast two-hybrid assay. An interacting protein was isolated. Sequencing and BLAST analysis revealed that the protein contained a C2-domain and was predicted to be a Ca2+ binding domain. The protein shared 80.24% identity in amino acids with a C2-domain protein in Arabidopsis with unknown function. The expression levels of the C2-domain protein in floral, leaf, and stem organs of oilseed rape were investigated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The C2-domain protein was highly expressed in leaves when inoculated with S. sclerotiorum.

Sclerotinia stem rot caused by this fungus affects main crops and has led to great economic loss. Elicitors are a group of compounds that inspire the host plant to produce an immune response against invading pathogens. This study describes a protein that has high homology with the Trichoderma elicitor Sm1 and was found in the genome of S. sclerotiorum. We named this protein SsSm1. To determine whether this protein has an elicitor function like its homology protein, we constructed a heterologous expression vector for SsSm1 and expressed it in Escherichia coli. The protein of heterologous expression led to the formation of lesions in tobacco that closely resemble hypersensitive response lesions. Transient expression of the encoding gene of SsSm1 in tobacco leaves also caused hypersensitive response. Then, RNA silencing was used to identify the function of SsSm1. The hyphal growth and pathogenicity of silenced transformants were shown to be obviously lagging and branched abnormally. Transformants produced less infection cushions and deformed sclerotiorum. In addition, SsSm1 silencing caused weak tolerance to NaCl, sorbitol and SDS, and the sensitivity of mutants to carbendazim was also significantly decreased. Based on the above results, we speculate that this protein may be related to the development of hyphae, infection cushions and sclerotiorum, but the specific molecular mechanism needs to be studied further.","2018-05-01","2021-01-12 07:38:29","2021-01-12 07:38:29",NA,"37-46",NA,NA,270,NA,"Plant Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"(Lib.) de Bary; Cerato-platanin; Elicitor; HR; RNAi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Morphological and melanization aspects during sclerotial development were evaluated by microscopy and qRT-PCR techniques. S. sclerotiorum produces sclerotia with different phases of maturation and melanization during growth in PDA medium. Using scanning electron microscopy we observed that there are no structural differences in the three stages of formation of melanized and non-melanized sclerotium. Through histochemical analysis we observed that the melanized sclerotium accumulates more glycogen and produces less protein than non-melanized sclerotia. Melanin was most commonly found in the rind of melanized sclerotia, and the highest concentration of lipofucsins was found in non-melanized sclerotia. These molecules are products of the lipid peroxidation pathway and are associated with oxidative stress during differentiation in fungi. The expression of histidine kinase (shk) and adenylate cyclase (sac) genes in melanized and non-melanized sclerotiawere also evaluated. The higher gene expression of shk and lesser expression of sac in non-melanized sclerotiais an indication of the participation of cell signaling in the development of these structures. The higher expression of polyketide synthase (pks), tyrosinase (tyr) and laccase (lac) in non-melanized sclerotia suggested that S. sclerotiorum can use the DHN and L-dopa pathways to produce melanin. Expression studies of the enzymes chitin synthase and glucan synthase suggest that this process occurs along with the formation of melanin. This is interesting since polysaccharides, such as chitin and Î²-1,3-glucan, serve as a scaffold to which the melanin granules are cross-linked.","2019-12-01","2021-01-12 07:38:30","2021-01-12 07:38:30",NA,"126326",NA,NA,229,NA,"Microbiological Research",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Development; Melanin synthesis; Sclerotium",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

No cultivars planted in South Africa have been screened for the presence of these QTLs and their underlying markers, and limited current information on the resistance of these cultivars is available. A detached leaf assay was used to assess resistance of 29 soybean cultivars that are commercially grown in South Africa at temperatures of 20â€¯Â°C and 25â€¯Â°C as well as under low and high relative humidity. These cultivars were further screened for resistance to Sclerotinia stem rot using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, that are linked to resistance traits associated with Sclerotinia stem rot in soybean. Detached leaf assays revealed a significant difference (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.001) in disease response across tested cultivars, while SSR markers revealed 10 cultivars that potentially have genetic-based resistance against Sclerotinia stem rot.

In an initial investigation, A. siro was found to transmit the mycoparasite from infected to uninfected sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum in moist sterile sand and non-sterile soil. Subsequently, a simple assay system to monitor transfer of C. minitans from colonised wheat grains to uninfected sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum was developed. Both A. siro and F. candida transmitted C. minitans at least 55mm to sclerotia in soil at water potentials ranging from saturation to âˆ’3.6MPa. Transmission by A. siro was greater in drier conditions (âˆ’0.25 to âˆ’3.6MPa) as mites survived poorly in saturated soil. However, water potentials between saturation to âˆ’3.6MPa had no effect on transmission by F. candida, although collembolans died after 18d at water potentials of âˆ’5.4MPa or drier. Generally, maximum dispersal occurred within 2weeks. In soil lacking added arthropods, negligible spread of the mycoparasite was observed.

As fungal secondary metabolites are known for their toxicological activities and therapeutic effects, this study investigated the chemical profile, mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of an aqueous extract of S. sclerotiorum (AESS). A chemical profile of alkaloids, carbohydrates and isocoumarins was determined by NMR and UHPLC-UV-DAD-HRMS analysis. For colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 and non-cancer CCD-18Co cell lines, cytotoxic IC50 was 0.01598 and 0.04712ppm, and ROS generation were induced up to 22â€“51% and 12â€“21%, respectively. Genes including FAS, FASL, Caspases, PARP, p53, BAX, BIM and SURVIVIN mRNA involved in the apoptosis were upregulated up to 150â€“350% in both cells at 0.005â€“0.02ppm of AESS. In vivo study, the percentage of micronuclei was increased to 288% at 1000mg/kg b.w., indicating mutagenic effects. AESS did not cause breaks in DNA, as shown by the comet assay. As conclusions, AESS possesses cytotoxic activities where the IC50 in non-cancer cells is higher when compared to cancer cells, which may be useful in cancer treatment.","2016-02-01","2021-01-12 07:38:35","2021-01-12 07:38:35",NA,"27-35",NA,NA,80,NA,"Food Research International",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sclerotia; Fungus; Comet assay; DNA-damage; Micronuclei test; Mutagenicity; NMR; PCR",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As more and more serious resistance of S.Â sclerotiorum against commonly used fungicides, development of novel biorational fungicides to control this fungal has become more and more urgent. In this study, the activity of cuminic acid isolated from the seed of Cuminum cyminum L, was assessed. The median effective concentration (EC50) values for inhibition of mycelial growth of 78 S.Â sclerotiorum strains ranged from 5.46 to 29.34Â Î¼g/ml, with an average EC50 value of 17.36Â Â±Â 2.28Â Î¼g/ml. Meanwhile, both in pot experiments and on detached leaves, cuminic acid exhibited significant control effects against S.Â sclerotiorum. After treated with cuminic acid, mycelia were clustered seriously and the surface were collapsed and shriveled. In S.Â sclerotiorum, cell membrane permeability would be increased while oxalic acid content would be decreased and glycerol content would be increased significantly treated with cuminic acid. Above all, cuminic acid showed the potential as a natural alternative to commercial fungicides or a lead compound to develop new fungicides for the control of Sclerotinia stem rot.","2017-11-01","2021-01-12 07:38:36","2021-01-12 07:38:36",NA,"76-83",NA,NA,101,NA,"Crop Protection",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Disease management; Sclerotinia stem rot; Botanical fungicide; p-isopropyl benzoic acid",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The mean EC50 (Effective Concentration) and Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for fludioxonil based on inhibition of mycelial growth of 120 wild-type isolates were 0.015Â Â±Â 0.005Â Î¼g/ml and <0.05Â Î¼g/ml, respectively. Positive cross-resistance was not detected between fludioxonil and benzimidazole fungicides but was detected between fludioxonil and dicarboximide fungicides which are considered as high resistance risk fungicides by FRAC, even though these fungicides have different molecular structures. By growing wild-type isolates on potato dextrose agar (PDA) containing sublethal concentrations of the fungicide, we obtained four fludioxonil-resistant mutants with resistance factors (EC50 resistant/EC50 sensitive phenotypes) >2000. The laboratory fludioxonil mutants were less fitter than their parental isolates in terms of mycelial radial growth, pathogenicity and sclerotial production. Moreover, on PDA amended with NaCl, the laboratory fludioxonil mutants grew more slowly than their fludioxonil-sensitive parents, especially at lower concentrations of NaCl. According to the fitness of mutants and the cross-resistance between fludioxonil and dicarboximide fungicides, phenylpyrroles can be considered to pose a moderate resistance risk. In a field trial, fludioxonil provided greater control (over 90% disease control) of S.Â sclerotiorum than iprodione.","2011-07-01","2021-01-12 07:38:36","2021-01-12 07:38:36",NA,"876-882",NA,7,30,NA,"Crop Protection",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Baseline sensitivity; Resistance; Fludioxonil",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
